## ✨ Features

Worf is yet another style launcher, heavily inspired by **wofi**, **rofi**, and **walker**. Built from the ground up with Rust and GTK4, it offers exceptional performance and modern styling capabilities.

### 🎪 Multiple Modes Support

- 🧮 **Math** - Including binary/hex conversion and bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`)
- 🚀 **DRun** - Desktop application launcher
- 📁 **File** - File browser and launcher
- 🖥️E **SSH** - Quick SSH connection launcher
- ⚡ **Run** - Command execution
- 😊 **Emoji** - Emoji picker
- 🔍 **Web Search** - Quick web searches
- 🤖 **Auto** - Intelligent mode detection

### 🧠 Smart Auto Mode

Auto mode intelligently detects what you're trying to do! Use these prefixes for quick access:

| Prefix        | Mode       | Description                          |
|---------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| `ssh`         | SSH        | Connect to servers (optional prefix) |
| `?`           | Web Search | Search the web                       |
| `/`, `$`, `~` | Files      | Browse filesystem                    |

## ⚙️ Setup

### ⚒️ Dependencies

* GTK4
* Wayland
* GTK4 layer shell

#### Arch

```bash
sudo pacman -S gtk4 gtk4-layer-shell
```

#### Ubuntu
Ubuntu does not ship gtk4-layer-shell in a supported version. 
Therefore it must be build manually

```bash
sudo apt install -y librust-gdk4-sys-dev \
    libglib2.0-dev libgtk-layer-shell-dev libgtk-layer-shell0 gir1.2-gtklayershell-0.1 \
    libgtk-4-dev gobject-introspection libgirepository1.0-dev gtk-doc-tools python3 valac \
    git cmake gcc meson ninja-build
    
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell
cd gtk4-layer-shell
meson setup -Dexamples=true -Ddocs=true -Dtests=true build
ninja -C build
sudo ninja -C build install
sudo ldconfig
```

#### Installing Worf

Install from crates.io (recommended):

```bash
cargo install worf-launcher
```

Or build from source if you need the latest code:

Before building, make sure you have the rust toolchain (at least 1.88) installed.
This is described here https://rustup.rs/

Then run the following commands to clone & build the application
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexmohr/worf
cd worf
cargo build --release
```

You will find all worf binaries, including the examples, in `./target/release`.
Copy the binaries you need into a path that is part of `$PATH`, for example `/usr/bin`.
Installing via cargo (once available) will put the binaries in `$HOME/.cargo/bin`.

On debian based systems, Cargo-deb can be used to build a deb package for installation purposes. Note, the deb package cannot be distributed at this time, it can only be used on the system that built worf. Within the root of the git repo, run the following:

Install cargo-deb
```bash
cargo install cargo-deb
```

Create deb package and install

```bash
cargo deb -p worf-launcher
sudo apt install ./target/debian/worf-launcher-xxxx.deb
```


## Configuring Worf

Worf configuration files are looked up in the following directories
* Configuration file passed on the command line with `--conf`
* `$XDG_CONF_DIR/worf/config`
* `$HOME/.config/worf/config`

When no file is found, the defaults will be used.
Same is true for the style sheet, expect the filename will be `style.css`

All configuration options can also be set via the command line.

### Configuration options

This section describes all configuration options available for Worf, including their default values and usage. 
At the end, you will find a sample TOML configuration with all options set to their defaults.
All configuration options can also be set on the command line. Run `worf --help` for details.
The command line options have precedence over the configuration file.

## 📚 Library Usage

🔧 **Developer-Friendly**: Worfs launcher and UI components are available as a separate crate for building custom launchers.

* [crates.io/crates/worf-launcher](https://crates.io/crates/worf-launcher). 
* [docs.rs/worf-launcher](https://alexmohr.github.io/worf/).

## 🔄 Wofi Migration Guide

### ✅ What's Compatible

- **Themes**: Mostly compatible with existing wofi themes
- **Selectors**: Same entity IDs for easy migration
- **Core Functionality**: Similar behavior and features

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- Runtime behaviour is not guaranteed to be the same and won't ever be, this includes error messages and themes.
- Themes in general are mostly compatible. Worf is using the same entity ids, because worf is build on GTK4 instead of GTK3 there will be differences in the look and feel.
- Configuration files are not 100% compatible, Worf is using toml files instead, for most part this only means strings have to be quoted
- Color files are not supported
- line_wrap is now called line-wrap
- Wofi has a C-API, that is not and won't be supported, but Worf can be used as a rust library.
- Most boolean options now need true or false as argument, as Worf is using the same struct for config and command line arguments and this is the only way to merge both data sources
- Removed x,y offset and global coords as GTK4 does not support this anymore, similar results can be achieved with `--location`
- Removed copy_exec as we are not executing a binary to copy data into the clipboard
- `exec-search` not supported
- `parse-search` not supported
- `pre_display_exec` not supported
- `pre-display-cmd` not supported
- All custom keys that change the default bindings for navigation like up, down, page, etc.
- key_custom_(n) is not supported, such specialized behaviour can be achieved via the API though.

If any of these is breaking changes is an blocker for you to migrate to Worf, open an issue and it's probably fixable.
Options marked as `not supported` are mainly marked this way because I didn't figure out a use case where this is useful for me
and likely there is a technical solution to fix this, so please reach out. :

#### Removed Command Line Arguments
- `mode` → Use `show` instead
- `dmenu` → Use `show` instead
- `D` → Arguments = config now
- `dark` → Auto-detected from theme
- `filter-rate` → No longer needed, Worf is fast enough

#### Removed configuration Options
- `stylesheet` → Use `style` instead
- `color`/`colors` → Use GTK4 CSS instead
